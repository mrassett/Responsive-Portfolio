        <div id="first">
        <p> A writing and advertising graduate of Metropolitan State University, I now work in the commercial underwriting sector as an International Underwriting Associate for Berkley Technology Underwriters. Recently (very recently) I started studying computer programming at the University of Minnesota, to try and learn how to write software. Upon completion I will have experience in writing software, risk, &amp; advertisements. Sadly none of these fields are related or correlate whatsoever. I may have wanted for direction in my earlier professional years, but I have always had an eagerness to learn and grow. I love learning new things, and enjoy new situations and environments. I am not afraid to grab the bull by the horns! Assuming I am not actually confronted with a fully grown, un-castrated &amp; agitated steer.</p> 
        <p> In my spare time I like to spend time with my dog &amp; cat, read (Harry Potter), collect idioms, try new things, and watch anything fantasy or sci-fi. I also love to exercise. I have completed several half-marathons, mini triathlons and - only one - full marathon. Someday I hope to scuba dive the great barrier reef and walk the Camino de Santiago. Cheers!</p>
